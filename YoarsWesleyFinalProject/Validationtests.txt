For tests 1-4, I did not have to change anything after I got the first addition button correct.

Test 1: 2+2 (testing the addition button)
Test 2: 5-2 (testing the subtraction button)
Test 3: 5*4 (testing the multipulcation button)
Test 4: 10/2 (testing the division button)

For tests 5-7, I had to get rid of the second input in order for it to work properly. This is because
the app was taking the value of the second values, not the first values.

Test 5: 6% (testing the percentage button)
Test 6: 7^2 (testing the squared button)
Test 7: sqrt(9) (testing the sqrt button)
